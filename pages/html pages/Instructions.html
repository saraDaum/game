    <div id="instructions"><h1>So before you start, Some instructions:</h1><br>You need to find out which four colors your computer has selected from six colors.<br>
        Note: Do not choose one color twice!<br>
       Once you have selected the colors and clicked 'Continue',<br> you will see the four colors you have selected and the score on them.<br>
       A white circle shows you the right color that is also in the right position<br> while a red circle shows the right color that is not in the right place.<br>
       For your convenience, the number of guesses is not limited.</div>
